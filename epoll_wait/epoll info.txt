The program calls epoll_wait to wait for events to occur on the monitored file descriptors.
The epoll_wait system call blocks until at least one event occurs or until a specified timeout elapses.

***********************************************************

epoll_wait Returns:
epoll_wait returns with information about the events that occurred, such as the file descriptor and the type of event.

***********************************************************

epoll ? 
epoll is a Linux kernel system call for a scalable I/O event notification mechanism, first introduced in version 2.5. 44 of the Linux kernel. Its function is to monitor multiple file descriptors to see whether I/O is possible on any of them.

***********************************************************

file descriptor: 

A file descriptor is a unique identifier or an integer value that the operating system uses to represent an open file, socket, or other I/O (input/output) resources. In Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, file descriptors are a fundamental concept for interacting with files, devices, and communication channels.

File Descriptor 0 (FD 0): Standard Input (stdin)
File Descriptor 1 (FD 1): Standard Output (stdout)
File Descriptor 2 (FD 2): Standard Error (stderr)

***********************************************************

return : 
When successful, epoll_wait() returns the number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, or zero if no file descriptor became ready during the requested timeout milliseconds. When an error occurs, epoll_wait() returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.


***********************************************************

#include <sys/epoll.h>

int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout);

***********************************************************

Errors :

EBADF  epfd is not a valid file descriptor.

EFAULT The memory area pointed to by events is not accessiblewith write permissions.

EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or maxevents is less than or equal to zero.


***********************************************************

epoll_wait is a system call in Linux that is used for asynchronous I/O event notification. It waits for events on an epoll instance referred to by the provided file descriptor (epfd). The function monitors a set of file descriptors for specified events and blocks until one or more of these events occur or until a timeout is reached. The events are returned in an array of struct epoll_event, which contains information about the file descriptors that are ready for the specified events. The epoll_wait call can be configured to block indefinitely (timeout set to -1), return immediately (timeout set to 0), or wait for a specified duration in milliseconds. This system call is commonly used in scalable and high-performance network programming to efficiently handle a large number of file descriptors and events without the need for constant polling.
